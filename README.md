#docker-phpipam

Rebuilding to use ubuntu and the lastest version of PHPIPAM

phpIPam (PHP IP Address Management)
phpipam is an open-source web IP address management application. Its goal is to provide light and simple IP address management application.

Goal of this repository is to provide a lightweight docker image that can be used to have applciation running quickly.

## Running the application
I have tried to make it as simple as possible to run the application quickly. Therefore you can use docker-compose or just docker engine itself to start.

### Docker compose
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeffbildz/phpipam/master/docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up -d
```
The above will start complete service which includes mysql container with database.
Before running you might want to change passwords being used as they have not been made for production environments.

### Docker engine
```
docker run -d --name SomeContainerNameIPAM \
           -p "127.0.0.1:8181:80" \
           -e MYSQL_DB_HOSTNAME=Welcome1
           -e MYSQL_DB_USERNAME=admin
           -e MYSQL_DB_PASSWORD=Password1
           -e MYSQL_DB_NAME=exampleDB
           -e MYSQL_DB_PORT=3306
           --network="bridge" \
           --restart=on-failure:3 \
           --log-driver=json-file \
           --log-opt max-size=100m \
           --log-opt max-file=3 \
           --log-opt labels=phpipam \
           rafpe/docker-phpipam

```

The above is minimalistic version which require you to provide details for mysql connection using environment variables.

```shell
